The Elite Four (Japanese: 四天王 The Big Four) are four Pokémon Trainers who are regarded as the toughest in their regional **Kanto/Johto Pokémon League**. Those who challenge the Elite Four must have won all eight Badges between Kanto & Johto. Trainers must face all four and the current Champion consecutively without losing to any of them to be able to participate in the knockout stage.
