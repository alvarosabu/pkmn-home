# Elite Four

The Elite Four (Japanese: 四天王 The Big Four) are four Pokémon Trainers who are regarded as the toughest in their regional Pokémon League, just short of the Pokémon League Champion. Those who challenge the Elite Four must have won all eight Badges from that region (or, for Trainers in Alola, must have completed all of their island challenge trials). To become Champion, Trainers must face all four and the current Champion consecutively without losing to any of them.

One group resides at the Indigo Plateau in Kanto and are considered the best Trainers in both Kanto and Johto. Another group is located in Ever Grande City in Hoenn, while another is located on Mount Lanakila in Alola. Three more groups reside at the Pokémon Leagues in Sinnoh, Unova, and Kalos.
